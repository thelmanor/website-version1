			She is also a frequent contributor to the <a href= "https://thelmanor.wixsite.com/gymwithwisdom" target= "_blank"> gymwithwisdom</a> blog which focuses on spreading <br>
			words of wisdom for mental enlightenment while exposing potential pitfalls that could arise from <br>
			failure to protect one’s mental health as diligently as one protects one’s physical health.</p>
