									Know Your Desired Outcome...</a></h3>
							<p> A great performer knows his/her desired outcome before they go on stage... 
							A good surgeon knows his desired outcome before he begins an operation...			 
							An excellent Architect has a definition of his desired outcome in his mind before he begins to design...			 
							A talented builder has his desired outcome on paper before he begins the construction of a building...			 
							Likewise a person who is determined to loss weight over a period of time always has to start with a desired weight goal in mind...			 
							How much more when we determine that we want to be successful in life....that is when it is most important that we know our desired outcome...</p>

						  <p>Mental Fitness Tip: "Being busy does not always mean real work. 
						  The object of all work is production or accomplishment and to either
						  of these ends there must be forethought, system planning, intelligence,
						  and honest purpose, as well as perspiration. Seeming to do is not doing."
						  - Thomas A. Edison.</p>
